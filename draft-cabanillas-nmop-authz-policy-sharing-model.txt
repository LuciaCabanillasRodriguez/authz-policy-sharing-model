           Model for distributed authorization policy sharing
        draft-cabanillas-nmop-authz-policy-sharing-model-latest

Abstract

   This document defines mechanisms and conventions for the
   representation, lifecycle management, and distribution of
   authorization policies in distributed and automated environments.  It
   specifies a consistent, machine-readable, and interoperable framework
   that enables policies to be validated, versioned, exchanged, and
   removed across heterogeneous systems and domains.

   The framework defines how authorization policies, expressed in
   declarative Policy-as-Code (PaC) languages, are encapsulated,
   managed, and distributed using YANG as the canonical representation
   format.  This separation allows independent evolution of policy
   languages, enforcement architectures, and trust models.

1.  Introduction

   The increasing complexity and automation of distributed systems, such
   as programmable networks, multi-cloud platforms, and intent-based
   infrastructures, require scalable and interoperable mechanisms for
   managing authorization policies.  In these environments, policies are
   no longer confined to static configuration files or manually managed.
   Instead, they are dynamic artifacts that must be created, validated,
   distributed, updated, and eliminated programmatically.

   Authorization policies increasingly govern not only access control
   but also operational behavior, compliance requirements, and
   governance constraints across multiple domains.  These policies may
   be authored in one domain, distributed through another, and enforced
   in many.  As a result, consistent handling of policies throughout
   their lifecycle becomes critical.

   Existing approaches often rely on system-specific policy formats and
   ad hoc distribution mechanisms, leading to several challenges:

   *  Fragmentation: Incompatible representations and semantics hinder
      interoperability and auditability.

   *  Limited lifecycle control: Many systems lack standardized
      mechanisms for validation, versioning, and decommissioning.

   *  Trust ambiguity: In multi-domain environments, it is often unclear
      whether a policy source is authorized or trustworthy.

   *  Governance gaps: Systems frequently lack mechanisms to verify
      whether a policy author is permitted to define policies for a
      specific domain.

   To address these challenges, this document defines a structured and
   interoperable framework for representing and managing authorization
   policies as governed artifacts.  YANG is used as the canonical
   representation format for policy artifacts.  A YANG-defined policy
   encapsulates its metadata together with embedded declarative Policy-
   as-Code content, which is treated as opaque executable logic.  This
   structured representation enables schema-based validation, immutable
   semantic versioning, and verifiable lifecycle transitions while
   remaining agnostic to the underlying evaluation engine.

   *  Policy-as-Code (PaC): A paradigm in which policies are represented
      as declarative code artifacts, allowing automation, versioning,
      and testing.

3.  Requirements for Policy Management

   Systems that manage or exchange authorization policies across domains
   MUST satisfy the following requirements:

   *  Granularity: Policies SHOULD be able to express fine-grained
      authorization rules over users, resources, and contextual
      conditions.

   *  Lifecycle control: Policies MUST support creation, versioning,
      validation, and removal.

   *  Interoperability: Policy representations SHOULD be portable and
      interpretable across different administrative domains.

   *  Verifiability: The framework MUST provide mechanisms to verify
      policy integrity and provenance.

4.  Policy-as-Code and Declarative Policy Languages

   Declarative Policy-as-Code (PaC) languages, such as Rego [Rego],
   Cedar [Cedar], or ALFA [ALFA], are widely used to express
   authorization logic in distributed systems.  Although these languages
   differ in syntax, evaluation models, and execution environments, they
   share common lifecycle and governance requirements when used in
   distributed and multi-domain environments.

   This framework treats PaC content as opaque executable logic embedded
   within a YANG-defined policy artifact.  The YANG representation does
   not interpret, validate, or constrain the internal semantics of the
   policy language.  Instead, it provides a structured and interoperable
   container for lifecycle governance, version control, provenance
   binding, and distribution.

   By separating policy handling from policy semantics, including
   evaluation logic and decision outcomes, this framework enables
   interoperability without constraining innovation in policy languages
   or enforcement technologies.

   Example in Rego syntax:

   package example
   # Allow read access if the user has the "read" role
   default allow = false
   allow {
       input.user.role == "read"
   }

   The policy logic above is treated as opaque content by the YANG
   representation.  Its evaluation behavior is determined exclusively by
   the target execution environment, while lifecycle and governance
   properties such as version and ownership are managed independently.

5.  Policy representation in YANG

   YANG provides a structured and schema-driven mechanism for
   representing authorization policies as managed and governed
   artifacts.  In this framework, YANG serves as the canonical container
   format for policy definitions, encapsulating:

   *  Policy metadata, including owner, description and version.

   *  The declarative language used to express the policy logic.

   *  The embedded Policy-as-Code (PaC) content, treated as opaque data.

   *  Optional leaf for validation and provenance.

   Each policy instance MUST include a semantic version following a
   controlled versioning scheme (for example, Git-style tags such as
   v1.0.0).  Version values MUST uniquely identify immutable policy
   content.  Once a specific version is stored, it MUST NOT be modified.
   Any change to the policy logic or its governance metadata MUST result
   in the creation of a new version.  Versioning is therefore a
   fundamental requirement of Policy-as-Code governance.  Maintaining
   historical versions enables controlled updates, rollback to previous
   versions, auditability, and forensic analysis in case of
   misconfiguration or dispute.

   In addition, each policy instance MUST include an explicit owner
   attribute that identifies the authority responsible for the policy
   definition, ensuring accountability within and across domains.  By
   associating a policy with a clearly identified authority, the
   framework enables governance controls and allows systems to determine
   whether the policy source is authorized within a given scope.  The
   owner attribute MUST be expressed as a URI that uniquely identifies
   the authoritative entity responsible for the policy.

   The specific URI structure is determined by the administrative
   environment.  Ownership metadata MAY be cryptographically linked to
   the policy provenance, enabling verification against the provenance
   signature key.  This mechanism ensures that the policy origin and
   integrity can be independently verified and trusted.

   The YANG model below illustrates a simplified structure for
   representing authorization policies as managed artifacts:

                # Allow read access if the user has the 'read' role
                default allow = false
                allow {
                    input.user.role ==\"read\"
                }";
        }
        leaf owner {
            type uri;
            mandatory true;
            description
                "URI identifying the authoritative entity responsible for this policy";
        }
        leaf version {
            type string;
            mandatory true;
            description
                "Semantic version of the policy following Git-style tags (e.g., v1.0.0)";
        }
        leaf policy-provenance {
            type iyangprov:provenance-signature;
            description
                "Signature proving provenance of the policy";
        }
    }
}

   This YANG snippet demonstrates how policy content can be represented
   as structured data while keeping the logic in a declarative format.
   By explicitly indicating the language, management systems can
   validate and process policies appropriately, enabling
   interoperability between tools and engines.

6.  Architecture Overview

   Policy management in distributed environments relies on a set of
   functional components that cooperate to define, govern, distribute,
   evaluate, and enforce authorization policies across administrative
   domains [RFC2904].  This framework adopts that functional separation
   while introducing structured policy representation and lifecycle
   governance based on YANG.

6.1.  Functional Roles

   Policy Author: The entity (human or automated system/agent)
   responsible for creating the policy definition.  The author produces
   a YANG-encoded policy document that includes metadata (description,
   version, language, owner) and the actual declarative rule.

   Policy Administration Point (PAP): The Policy Administration Point
   manages the lifecycle and governance of policy artifacts.  Upon
   receiving a YANG-encoded policy, it performs schema validation and,
   where applicable, verifies provenance using cryptographic mechanisms
   such as those described in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-yang-provenance].

   The PAP enforces version uniqueness and immutability, ensuring that
   existing versions are never modified.  Any change to policy content
   or metadata results in the creation of a new version.  The PAP
   maintains historical versions to support rollback and audit
   requirements.

   Before accepting or distributing a policy artifact, the Policy
   Administration Point (PAP) MAY perform an authorization verification
   step.  In this step, the PAP queries a Policy Decision Point to
   determine whether the declared owner or submitting entity is
   authorized to define or modify policies within the relevant domain.

   All lifecycle events, including creation, update, activation,
   rollback, and decommissioning, MUST be recorded in an append-only
   accounting ledger to ensure traceability and auditability.

   Once validated and authorized, the PAP distributes the executable
   policy artifact to the appropriate decision components.

   Policy Decision Point (PDP): The Policy Decision Point evaluates
   policy logic at runtime.  It receives validated policy artifacts and
   processes authorization requests based on contextual attributes,
   claims, or environmental information.  The PDP produces authorization
   decisions such as Permit or Deny, optionally including obligations or
   advice.

   Policy Enforcement Point (PEP): The PEP enforces the decisions issued
   by the PDP.  Enforcement may include granting or denying access,
   applying configurations, or triggering operational actions.

6.2.  Functional Interaction

   The interaction among the architectural components reflects a strict
   separation between policy governance and runtime decision-making.
   Policy artifacts are first validated, governed, and recorded as
   managed entities before being distributed for evaluation.

   The following diagram illustrates the logical interaction flow:

              +-----------------------------------+

7.  Other Models

   Existing data models demonstrate that YANG can be effectively used to
   carry authorization-related information in operational environments.

   The OpenConfig gNSI authorization model [OCgNSI] defines a YANG
   module that represents metadata associated with gRPC authorization
   policies installed on network devices.  That model focuses on device-
   level state and observability, including policy versioning, creation
   time, and success/failure counters collected during authorization
   evaluation.

   This document is complementary to that approach.  While the
   OpenConfig model concentrates on operational visibility for a
   specific enforcement technology, the framework defined here focuses
   on the representation, lifecycle management, provenance, and
   distribution of authorization policy artifacts across systems and
   administrative domains.

8.  Security Considerations

   Ensuring the integrity, authenticity, and provenance of policy data
   is critical to prevent unauthorized modification.  Policies SHOULD
   include cryptographic protection mechanisms that allow their origin
   and validity to be verified.

   The mechanisms defined in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-yang-provenance] —
   Applying COSE Signatures for YANG Data Provenance — provide a
   suitable foundation for these protections.  That document specifies
   how COSE signatures [RFC9052] are used to include digital signatures
   within the YANG data, enabling, in this case, verifiable provenance
   and ensuring the integrity of the YANG-based distributed
   authorization policy sharing model proposed in this draft.

   When such provenance mechanisms are applied to policy definitions,
   each policy instance can include a verifiable signature providing
   proof of origin and integrity of the provided policy.  By treating
   policies as signed, versioned artifacts, this framework reduces the
   risk associated with automated and cross-domain policy exchange,
   including the additional risks in multi-domain deployments such as
   determining whether a policy has been modified in transit and whether
   the policy issuer is authorized to define policies applicable to the
   receiving domain.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
